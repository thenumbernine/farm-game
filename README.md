## Harvest Dwarf Stardew Moon Secret of Mana Fortress Valley: Link to the Past

## So Far:

- you can dig dirt, chop down trees and wood tiles, and you can plop them down like any other voxel engine game.
- you can sleep in the bed and time will pass until the next day.
    - oh yes and there's realtime sunlighting on at least the top level of tiles.
- you can buy seeds from the shop guy.
- you can hoe ground, water ground, and plant seeds in ground.
- you can use your one sword to kill enemies.

## Controls:

- arrows move
- z = use item
- x = jump
- c = interact with world
- a = switch previous item
- s = switch next item
- d = open inventory
- q = rotate camera left
- w = rotate camera right
- `0-9, -, =` = select item in inventory bar.

When inventory is open, arrows navigate, and `interact with world` will drop the item.

## TODO:

- fishing.
	- casting line animation
	- test for water where the line lands, tangle the line in bushes otherwise
	- prepare / gut fish before cooking 
	- cook fish (over fireplace / stove + with pan)
	- fish tanks
	- live fish should run out of air on dry land
	- fish ponds for collecting fish
- cooking
- animals
	- pokeballs
	- when you buy an animal from the market, you should get a tether to walk it back to the farm. 
	- need fences and gates to keep livestock from getting away.
		- some animals trample your garden
		- some animals trample grass <-> dirt
		- some animals graze <-> have food points <-> can starve and die (same as you)
	- wild animals like coyotes, wolves, etc eat your chickens and cats if you don't keep them safe.
	- dingos eat your babies
	- butcher to gt ....
		- meat -> (cook over fireplace / stove + with pan)
		- skinning
			- tanning
- scarecrows to protect your crops
- hunting weapons
	- guns
		- bullets
	- bow
		- arrows
	- sling
	- crossbow
		- bolts
	- traps
		- mortal
		- live trapping animals
		- domesticate
			- train for fighting
- traceline 
	- for placement of items / tiles (preview where they'll go)
	- for determining where weapon/tool swings will land
	- for determining NPC interaction / talking
	- mix traceline with push() and walking
	- make walking step over half-tiles
	- make the default block placement / excavation be half-tile at a time

- digging:
	- if you dig ground, (or remove stone or wood or any tile), it should remove sprites on top of the ground (hoed, watered, seeded)
	- or if you try to dig ground that has a bush/tree on it, it should fail to dig.
	- half-step voxels for grass and stone, and maybe some slope tiles, and maybe rotate them in any of the 4 directions, so I don't have to jump everywhere (stupid Minecraft, why did you make that a standard?)
	- support rotating of half-step voxels
	- rotating/placing of non-cuboid voxels?  do i have any of these yet?  un-animated things, like beds etc? 
- biomes
	- make plants randomly seed neighboring ground... only if they naturally grow in this biome ofc.
- stats system.  level system.  weapon-skill-level system.  skill tree ofc because.
	- lots of equipment slots.  materia.
	- good battle system .
		- action-adventure style? TRPG maybe? realtime TRPG?
		- street fighter 2.  or secret of mana.  or both.
- monsters
	- any kind of movement in those goombas
- inventory
	- allow rearranging stuff in inventory.
	- equipment from inventory ...
		- equipment levels? skill levels? weapon levels? job levels?
- animation
	- player animations for sword, pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe, watering ...
		- sword swing etc should search only objs on the neighboring tiles, not all objs
			- region iterator, index for last region iterator
- super duper customizable character sprite
- probably better align billboard sprites with where in 3D they are.
- rendering
	- make sure hoed / watered / seeded always render in correct order (z-sort by altitude? or store and render as attribut list per-tile?)
		- maybe overhaul rendering, esp the more modifiers to tiles that I add?
		- maybe make hoed/watered as bitflags, and have the map chunk system handle them?
	- lighting
		- better map lighting.  underground lighting.  any kind of falloff lighting.  any kind of better daylight shadow lighting.
		- bump-mapping on sprites?  parallax mapping?
			- cheap method, greyscale sprite <-> bumpmap height.
			- also add/mul a distance-from-closest-transparent-pixel to make sure sprites look round.
		- sprites cast shadows on the ground?
	- use GPU to build geometry ... atomics + write ... need a compute/geometry shader?
	- use GPU to do physics updates ...
- physics
	- heat modeling
	- CFD/SPH fluids, water, magma, oil, acid, quicksand, poisonous gas
		- drainage / aquifers / accumulate standing water / erosion modeling w/ landscape generation
	- model collapsing of structures.  no more building a giant horizontal platform attached at a single point to the wall.
	- GPU-driven physics.
		- GPU-driven detection
		- less `CPU<->GPU` copies of the sprite data
	- allow the player to refine seeds from fruit & veg
- weather
	- rain
		- accumulates in puddles (drainage ...)
		- floods
	- snow
		- also accumulates
			- snow melt. drainage once again.
	- hail.
		- golfball/tennisball sized hail which destroys crops
- plants
	- redo all the tree / bush / plant pics procedurally or something, esp to have one per 792 plants listed at the store right now.
	- unique seed sprites, to go with the unique veg and plant and fruit sprites.
	- only grow plants if their ground is watered
		- rain also waters
		- so does sprinklers
		- so does near a body of water (lake, river, etc)
			- irrigation also waters
	- if a plant isn't watered, if it's native to the biome then it still grows
	- maybe something about plant root system vs soil moisture vs Ph balance etc ... 
- economy
	- limit the seed shop to a subset of all seeds.  maybe multiple seed shops?
		- higher price for more exotic seeds?
	- selling produce option?
		- trash bucket like SDV?  or is that too nonsense, that you can teleport stuff at any time for money.
		- shipping box like SDV, but becuse you're not there to man the booth you always get ripped off.
		- on-farm trade-depot, but only when the Mountainhome Caravan comes once a ... week.  or when customers come.  infrequently.
		- farmers market, once a saturady or something.  or any day.  you get lots of customers and sell at higher price.
			- later you can hire someone to man the booth for you and sell even more round-the-clock.
			- plants in-biome should cost less than plants out of biome
- gems.  metals.  pickaxe quality levels.
- crafting
	- your own forge for making stuff.
		- I guess you'll have to talk to Robin to build a forge.  j/k.  but it won't just be an anvil like Minecraft. You'll have to build more.
		- or go to the guy in the town who is named Clint.
		- or go to the Dwarf.
- caves
	- better dungeon/cave area.  not just mindless simplex noise or caves.  more like floodfill dungeons on a coarser resolution (like 8x8x8).
		- more monsters in caves than on surface.
	- underground biome
		- plantable mushrooms, plump helmets, etc
- disasters
- rodents, crop fungus, hurricaines... goblin raiding party.
- give logs plant-type. color them too just like seeds.  and add all those trees to the plant list.
- Better separate game-player from game-obj-player.  move all the UI stuff / clientside-only to game-player, all serverside to game-obj-player.
- generalize tile placement
	- tile orientation is added, but make it do something.  won't matter until i get more than just half-blocks ...
	- add material property to tiles ... either color, or some other way to change it based on the material ... and to store the material as well.
- coding
	- better linking/unlinking system than the current Lua-table-based
		- maybe instead something like a per-tile linked-list (tho i need multiple lists per obj), or a ptr-per-tile that points to a list of objs
	- map and sprite display buffers set to crash upon overflow.  mabye just top out, or even better, resize.
	- some kind of game update to run while sleeping, not as intense as a full game update
- player health
	- proper glycemic index and blood sugar level ... [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index) [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level)
		- also make sure this updates while sleeping.  in fact, fix the sleep cycle so it doesn't just set the time but calls :update() , but a limited form so it's not running monsters movements / physics...
	- food points, blood sugar level, etc
- add a grappling hook.
- app packaging
	- fix the distinfo project overall to auto package windows + linux (+osx?) all in one package.  i'm hacking it r.n. with a script.
- water
	- refilling the watering can
	- irrigation & sprinklers
	- fish farms
	- air supply while swimming / drowning
	- scuba diving
		- seafloor farming
		- buried treasure and sunken ships
